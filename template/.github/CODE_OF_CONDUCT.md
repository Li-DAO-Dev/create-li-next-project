# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of this project, are committed to building a safe, inclusive, and empowering community dedicated to promoting **democracy, freedom, free speech, and human rights in China**. We actively stand against authoritarianism, censorship, and any form of dictatorship.

In this spirit, we pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background, identity, or political belief (except in support of authoritarianism or oppression).

## Our Values and Standards

We value:

- Freedom of expression and the right to dissent
- Respect for human dignity and fundamental rights
- Constructive collaboration and open dialogue
- Inclusivity and support for marginalized voices
- Transparency and accountability

Examples of respectful behavior that helps create a positive environment:

- Using inclusive and respectful language
- Engaging in thoughtful, critical discussions—even when opinions differ
- Actively supporting democratic values and civil liberties
- Calling out injustice and standing up for those whose voices are silenced
- Supporting others in their learning and contributions

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks
- Endorsing or promoting dictatorship, political violence, or authoritarian ideology
- Dismissing or suppressing calls for human rights or democratic reform
- Disrupting conversations with propaganda, trolling, or disinformation
- Violating others’ privacy or engaging in doxxing

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are expected to uphold these values and act fairly in enforcing this Code of Conduct. They may remove, edit, or reject contributions that go against our principles, or ban contributors who engage in harmful behavior.

We have a zero-tolerance policy for actions or speech that promote dictatorship, censorship, or oppression.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces, including online platforms, events, and communications representing the project. It extends to public behavior when an individual is acting as a representative of the community.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness any form of unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project team at **[dev@lidao.pro](mailto:dev@lidao.pro)**.

Reports will be handled with care, confidentiality, and urgency. The safety and integrity of our contributors, especially those in high-risk environments, is our top priority.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The project team will take the following steps in response to violations:

1. **Investigation** – Promptly and impartially reviewing the situation.
2. **Action** – Issuing warnings, removing content, or banning users as necessary.
3. **Appeal** – Providing an opportunity to appeal enforcement decisions if requested.
